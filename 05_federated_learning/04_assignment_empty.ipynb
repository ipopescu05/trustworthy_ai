    "### Deliverables:\n",
    "Please submit, via Canvas, a **zip file** including the following:\n",
    "- a .ipynb file (you can use this one) with all of your code included -- `04_assignment_surname1_surname2.ipynb`\n",
    "- a compiled .html file of your .ipynb which includes all of the output -- `04_assignment_surname1_surname2.html`\n",
    "- a pdf file with your written answers to the questions -- `04_assignment_surname1_surname2.pdf`\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to follow the naming convention indicated above. The zip name can be named `04_assignment_surname1_surname2`.\n",

    "pip install -U flwr[\"simulation\"]\n",

    "**1.1** Follow this week's tutorial and perform federated learning on the 'cifar10' dataset. For this simulation, we want to implement the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Transform the data to tensors and normalize them. How did you choose the values for normalizing?\n",
    "- Define an appropriate model architecture for this dataset. The one we used for the mnist dataset in the tutorial will not work for this dataset.\n",
    "- Run the simulation with 100 clients.\n",
    "- Perform 40 rounds in this simulation.\n",
    "- Every client's local training should run through 2 epochs.\n",
    "- Each round, we want only 20% of the clients to update their model by training it locally.\n",
    "- Each round, we want to use 10% of the clients for federated evaluation.\n",

    "You have been assigned a dataset for a binary classification problem. You can [see the allocation](https://github.com/tabearoeber/trustworthy_ai/blob/main/05_FederatedLearning/assignment%20material/dataset-allocation.pdf) in this file on the Github repository. It is your task to write a case study report where you fit a model to the data and apply multiple methods for explainable/interpretable AI. The final deliverable for this part of the assignment will be a report of 8-10 pages excluding references and appendix. See [this document for more information about the grading](https://github.com/tabearoeber/trustworthy_ai/blob/main/05_FederatedLearning/assignment%20material/report-grading.pdf) of the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements: \n",
    "- Discuss the data including a description of the context and descriptive statistics. \n",
    "- Discuss any data processing steps you take.\n",
    "- Fit a black box model to the data. Discuss your considerations during the modeling process. Also evaluate the performance of the model.\n",
    "- Choose **3 methods** from week 2 (glass box models), week 3 (unboxing methods), and week 4 (other XAI methods) to apply to your dataset / model. \n",
    "    - Choose **at least 1 glass box** method and **at least 1 post-hoc explanation** method\n",
    "    - The third method that you choose *can* be a method that we did not discuss in class, but doesn't have to be. Your third method may also be one of those discussed in class.\n",
    "    - For any post-hoc explanation methods that you choose, apply them to the black-box model that you trained.\n",
    "- Write an extensive evaluation and discussion comparing the chosen methods and their results.\n",
    "- Elaborate on the socio-ethical context of trustworthy AI and your specific dataset. \n",
    "- Provide your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please use [this latex template](https://github.com/tabearoeber/trustworthy_ai/tree/main/05_FederatedLearning/assignment%20material/TRAI_template) that I put on the Github reposiroty for your report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your final report should be have a maximum of 10 pages excluding references and appendix. Please shy away from too extensive appendices."
